        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
          <li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
          <li>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.</li>
          <li>Some HTML elements have no content eg: line break (br). They are called empty elements and don't have an end tag.</li>
          <li>Some HTML elements used to add content to a webpage include text, header, image, and list elements.</li>
          <li>Other HTML element types used to divide and describe a page include meta-related elements, content division elements, and semantic elements.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element (ex:lang="en"), they are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing one. </li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
            <li>An inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly inthe HTML file.</li>
            <li>Inline styles apply to specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
            <li>The internal style sheet allows you to include CSS code in "head" section of a markup document.</li>
            <li>External stylesheet works by linking a .css file, containing all the CSS rules, to an HTML document.</li>
            <li>The CSS box model demonstrates that every HTML element is a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding and content.</li>
            <li>Content inside of padding, padding inside of border, and border inside of margin.</li>

          <h2>Javascript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Javascript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
            <li>Using Javascript, you can power websites with effects, interactivity, data communication and more.</li>
            <li>Null is a special value in JS that refers to the absence of a value.</li>
            <li>Primitive values: immutable datum represented directly at the lowest level of the language. All types except objects define immutable values (values that can't be changed, e.g. Strings are immutable, once created they cannot be modified)</li>
            <li>Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false.</li>
            <li>Undefined type is a variable that has not been assigned a value.</li>
            <li>Numeric types include Number, BigInt and NaN.</li>
            <li>JS's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set od "elements" of 16-bit-unsigned integer values. Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. (e.g. first element is at index 0, next at index 1)</li>
            <li>The length of a String is the number of elements in it.</li>
            <li>It is possible to create another string based on an operation on the original string. A substring of the original by picking indiviudal letters or using substring() or a concentration of two strings using the concentration operator (+) or concat().</li>
            <li>Symbol type is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property. In some programming languages, Symbols are called "atoms".</li>
            <li>An object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier.</li>
            <li>An identifier is a sequence of characters in the code that identifies a variable, function or property. In JS, identifiers are case-sensitive and contain Unicode letters,$,_, and digits (0-9), but may not start with a digit.</li>
            <li>An identifier differs froma string inthat a string is data, while an identifier is part of the code.</li>
            <li>In JS, there is no way to convert identifiers to strings, but sometimes it is possible to parse strings into identifiers.</li>
            <li>In JS, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. Property values can be values of any type, including other objects.</li>
            <li>Properties are identified using key values. A key value is either a string value (a sequence of characters used to represent text) or a symbol value (a built-in object whose constructor retunrs a primitive thats guaranteed to be unique).</li>
            <li>Symbols are often used to add unique property keys to an object that won't collide with keys any other code might add to the object.</li>
            <li>In JS, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods of properties. There are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol and null.</li>
